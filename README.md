# Notes #

A minimalistic in-browser note taking application. The motivation for creating this app was how tedious it is to make and format documents in Evernote, that have code snippets in them.

* the notes are stored as plain html files in the file system
* editing a note works by putting it in an iframe with contentEditable body
* uses shortcuts everywhere instead of a nice GUI
* NodeJS backend, in-browser frontend
* the notes can be synced with the cloud by simply putting them in a Dropbox folder
